    <!-- Question-3
           • Semantic element in HTML5?

         Answer:-
          
            The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The main content area
         consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central
         functionality of an application.

            Semantics is about using the correct element in HTML. There are approximately 110 elements in HTML 5. Two of
         them have no meaning – <div> and <span> . They tell us nothing about the content.

          
       * Examples of semantic elements: 
                   <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
