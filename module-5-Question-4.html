           â€¢ Canvas and SVG tags

         Answer:-
             
              *Canvas:
                -> Raster based (composed of pixel)
                -> Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.
                -> The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The
                   <canvas> tag is transparent, and is only a container for graphics ...
                -> The <canvas> tag in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page using JavaScript. It can be used to
                   draw paths, boxes, texts, gradients, and adding images. By default, it does not contain borders and 
                   text. Note: The <canvas> tag is new in HTML5.

                

        
              *SVG:
               -> Vector based (composed of shapes)	
               -> SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.	 
               -> Definition and Usage. The <svg> tag defines a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for
                  drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
               -> SVG images can be written directly into the HTML document using the <svg> </svg> tag. To do this, open 
                  the SVG image in VS code or your preferred IDE, copy the code, and paste it inside the <body> element in
                  your HTML document. If you did everything correctly, your webpage should look exactly like the demo
                  below.
